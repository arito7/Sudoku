#### Process
I started by building a sudoku solver.
My initial approach was to solve this as a human would.
This approach worked for easy to medium difficulty puzzles but was 
not viable on extreme difficulty puzzles as the methods for solving 
a cell become increasingly abstract and difficult.
Ultimately I decided on a more brute force approach using recursion.
In order to make this recursive approach possible I converted
the 2d array into a 1 dimensional array containg all 81 cells.
Pseduocode
1. choose a number from a set containing the numbers 1 to 9
2. insert the number into current cell
3. check if the board is still valid
    if it is still valid
        repeat steps for next cell 
    if it is not valid
        repeat steps for this cell
            if we exhausted all numbers from the set return false
